          I’m a frontend developer who enjoys owning the full UI process — from
          user flow and UX decisions in Figma to implementation in Next.js and
          TypeScript. I focus on building interfaces that are clear, consistent,
          and easy to use, with code that stays maintainable as the product
          grows.

          I’m currently working in an AI-driven product environment where I
          designed a user flow and UI improvements, and we’re now implementing
          my designs in the frontend. I also use AI tools naturally in my
          workflow to speed up iteration and improve quality without sacrificing
          structure or clarity.
